# FirebasePhoneAuthenticationDemo
This is the simple demo to test how Firebase Phone Authentication works. After configuring Firebase and Push notification settings as mentioned here:https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/phone-auth, we can directly run this code and check how it works. NOTE: Change bundle identifier after downloading project.
